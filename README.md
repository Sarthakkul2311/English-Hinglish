# English to Hinglish Translator

## Overview
This project is a simple Python script that utilizes the Google Translate API, specifically its Neural Machine Translation (NMT) capabilities, to translate English text into Hinglish. Hinglish is a blend of Hindi and English, commonly used in India, where English and Hindi words are often mixed together.

#### Types of codes 
1) Hinglish in English and hindi: It translates english sentences into hinglish which contains English and hindi both. <br>
2) English to hinglish with all hindi: It translates english sentences into hinglish which contains hindi only.

### Sample of Hinglish in english and hindi:-
Statement: Definitely share your feedback in the comment section. <br>
Hinglish Translation: "निश्चित रूप से comment section में अपनी feedback साझा करें।"

Statement: So even if it's a big video, I will clearly mention all the products. <br>
Hinglish Translation: "तो भले ही यह एक बड़ा video है, मैं स्पष्ट रूप से सभी products का mention करूंगा।"

Statement: I was waiting for my bag. <br>
Hinglish Translation: "मैं अपने bag का wait कर रहा था।"

### Sample of hinglish all in hindi
English Statement: "Definitely share your feedback in the comment section." <br>

Expected Hinglish Translation: "तो भले ही यह एक बड़ा वीडियो है, मैं स्पष्ट रूप से सभी उत्पादों का उल्लेख करूंगा।"        

English Statement: "I was waiting for my bag." <br>
Expected Hinglish Translation: "मैं अपने बैग का इंतजार कर रहा था।"
